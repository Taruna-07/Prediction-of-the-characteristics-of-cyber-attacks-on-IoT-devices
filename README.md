# Prediction-of-the-characteristics-of-cyber-attacks-on-IoT-devices

Conducted research on cyber-attacks targeting IoT devices using a dataset of network traffic. Explored three strategies to predict attack characteristics: J48 decision tree analysis, association rule mining with Apriori, and K-means clustering.

Technology Used: 
â€¢ Weka (J48 decision tree), Apriori (association rule mining), K-means clustering.

While the J48 decision tree achieved an 83.11% accuracy in detecting attacks, association rule mining with Apriori proved less effective due to processing power limitations and inability to establish meaningful associations. K-means clustering faced challenges in capturing irregularly shaped clusters and varying densities inherent in IoT network traffic, as well as sensitivity to the choice of the number of clusters. These limitations highlight the need for more sophisticated approaches in predicting cyber-attacks on IoT devices.
